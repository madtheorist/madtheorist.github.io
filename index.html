        <p>I'm a data science consultant at Deloitte with interests in software development and climate physics. 
            Currently, I'm developing route optimization software in Python and SQL for a large telecommunications client in the UK.
            In a previous life, I studied physics at Oxford University, graduating with a first-class master's degree in 2023. </p>
